## Data Standardisation & Reporting Framework
This repo contains an R Markdown developed to support cross-ministry reporting by processing, cleaning, and standardising hundreds of disparate metrics submitted by 50+ global teams. The script transforms PowerBI exports into consistent datasets, visual summaries, and stakeholder-ready reporting outputs. It enables leadership to quickly interpret large volumes of data through reproducible, privacy-conscious analysis.

## Anonymisation & Data Privacy
All activity names, links, and identifiable fields in this repository have been intentionally anonymised. This version reflects the analytical structure while preserving organisational confidentiality.

## Key Functions
The parser was designed to:
  * Standardise inconsistent, team-reported metrics
  * Reduce manual data cleaning across quarterly reports
  * Categorise activities into strategic ministry groupings
  * Flag uncategorised or double-counted entries for review
  * Produce digestible insights for leadership and board reporting

## Outputs
The pipeline generates a flexible set of reporting assets, including:
  * Cleaned and categorised datasets
  * Summary tables for key sub-categories
  * Branded visualisations
  * Stakeholder-specific metric tables
  * Interactive HTML visual outputs for presentation use

Outputs are selected and adapted depending on the reporting audience (e.g., leadership, board, or internal teams). 

## Planned Improvements
  * Introducing more comparative and scalable chart types while continuing to align visual formats with stakeholder reporting preferences to ensure clarity, usability, and adoption.
  * Automated data ingestion from PowerBI exports
